# MI3AI

Mizai is an unofficial tool to pilot the monsters in Majestic 13.

Only the Monstrosities and Ravagers have been implemented for now. Stalkers will come soon. And maybe special enemies too at some point, but no guarantees.

Check the Release section on the right of the page for the downloads. There is also a link on the right for the web version of this tool.

## Known issues

 - The web version exists mainly as a demo and a last resort if you can't/don't want to use the platform-specific versions. It can look quite awful, with blurry fonts and messed up alignement of text inside buttons. Try to use other browsers to see if it gets better for you. Use the platform-specific releases for a better experience.
 - Going back during an action can be inconsistent. Avoid undoing after you passed an attack screen. It won't glitch the program, your monster will just appear to be changing its mind for no reason.
