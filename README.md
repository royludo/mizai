# MI3AI

Mizai is an unofficial tool to pilot the monsters in Majestic 13.

Check the link on the right for the web version of this tool.

## Install

It's a standard Flutter project. Follow the Flutter Getting Started instructions to setup a new project before cloning this repository.

## Known issues

 - The web app may look quite awful, with font problems and messed up alignement of text inside buttons and such. You can try to use other browsers to see if it gets better for you, or switch using a desktop computer or a mobile device as it also changes the look of the interface.
 - Going back during an action can be inconsistent. Avoid undoing after you passed an attack screen. It won't crash the program, your monster will just appear to be changing its mind for no reason.

 ## TODOs

  - add the special missions enemies
  - add proper undo management
  - completely refactor all this mess
  - try to provide native builds
